# Differential Drive Controller

This is my Differential Drive Controller project in **ROS2 Jazzy**, built for learning purposes.  
The project template is borrowed from the [official ros_gz_project_template](https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz_project_template), which integrates **ROS2** and **Gazebo**.

## About

I am **not** using `nav2` or `ros2_control` because my goal is to learn **navigation concepts** by implementing them from scratch, rather than just using existing APIs.  
This approach keeps things less overwhelming and helps me build a deeper understanding of the fundamentals.

## Quickstart

Installation process described in [INSTALL.md]()

## Goals

- [x] Basic control over vehicle
